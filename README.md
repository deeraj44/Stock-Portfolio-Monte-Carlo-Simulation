Imagine you're a fresh college graduate just starting your career. You plan to invest a fixed amount of money every year into a portfolio and want to estimate what your investments might be worth when you retire in 40 years. However, the stock market is unpredictable, with returns fluctuating each year.

To tackle this uncertainty, my project uses Monte Carlo Simulation to model the possible future values of your investment portfolio. This approach allows us to simulate thousands of different market scenarios by incorporating:

Annual Contribution: The fixed amount you invest each year.
Mean Return: The average expected return based on historical data.
Standard Deviation of Return: A measure of how much the returns fluctuate from year to year.
Time Horizon: The number of years until retirement (40 years in this case).
By running thousands of simulations, we can analyze a range of potential outcomes instead of just a single estimate. This gives us a probability-based understanding of how much the portfolio might be worth, helping investors make informed decisions about their financial future.

How It Works

The simulation considers several key factors:  
Annual Contribution: The fixed amount you invest each year.  
Mean Return: The average expected annual return, based on historical market data.  
Standard Deviation of Return: A measure of how much returns fluctuate each year.  
Time Horizon: The number of years until retirement (e.g., 40 years).  

By running thousands of simulations, the model generates a range of potential outcomes — from best-case scenarios to worst-case losses — providing a more realistic view of your investment’s future.
